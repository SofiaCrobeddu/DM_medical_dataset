-- Our SQL code for the queriesâ€™ optimization with indexes in some cases (Assignment 2) compared to un-optimized one (Assignment 1) is the following:

-- 1) Which are the products with an average number of reviews higher than 1000 and which is their type (RX for Prescription or OTC for Over-the-Counter)?
SELECT prod.name AS product_name, prod.type, AVG(prod.n_reviews) AS avg_reviews
FROM product prod
JOIN drug d ON prod.drug_id = d.id
WHERE d.id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY product_name, prod.type
HAVING AVG(prod.n_reviews) > 1000
ORDER BY avg_reviews DESC;


-- 2) Which is the most frequent drug sold and used?
SELECT d.name, d.id
FROM drug d
JOIN(
        SELECT drug_id, count(drug_id) AS freq
        FROM product 
        GROUP BY drug_id
        ORDER BY freq DESC
        LIMIT 1
) AS subpart ON d.id=subpart.drug_id;


-- 3) Which are the prices or the price's range of the most used drug?
CREATE INDEX idx_prod_drug_id ON product(drug_id);

SELECT MIN(p.price) AS min_price, MAX(p.price) AS max_price, COUNT(p.product_id)
FROM price p
JOIN product prod ON p.product_id=prod.id

-- 4) Which are the conditions treated by the most used drug?
CREATE INDEX idx_treat_drug_id ON treatment(drug_id);

SELECT COUNT(t.condition_id) AS frequency, cdt.name AS condition_name
FROM treatment t
JOIN condition cdt ON t.condition_id = cdt.id

-- 5) Which are the drugs' names to treat COVID-19?
CREATE INDEX idx_cond_name ON condition(name);

-- 7) Which is the drug prescribed for the highest number of conditions?
SELECT drug_id, COUNT(condition_id) AS num_conditions
FROM treatment

LIMIT 1;


-- 8) Which is the average price of each drug in descending order?
SELECT p.name, AVG(pr.price) AS avg_price
FROM product p
JOIN price pr ON p.id = pr.product_id
GROUP BY p.name
ORDER BY avg_price DESC;


-- 9) Which is the store that sells the greatest number of drugs?
-- The optimization is made using just 1 step.
SELECT name
FROM store

    FROM price
    GROUP BY store_id

-- 10) Which is the total number of drugs for each condition?
-- (implementation of the structure query 9)

-- 11) Which is the manufacturer which manufactures the majority of drugs?
-- (very similar in the structure to 9 and 10)

-- NOTE: the numbers below each table is the last running time of each query, comparing the time of the two.
-- NOTE: Even though our dataset has many tables, it is quite small. This is the main reason for the very fast execution of the queries and the small
